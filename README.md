# Avenger-Ensemble

This repository developed for the paper [Genetic Algorithm-Driven Ensemble Selection for Deep Learning-based Side-Channel Analysis](https://sprint.iacr.org/2024/1949)

We proposed a new genetic algorithm-driven ensemble selection algorithm called Evolutionary Avenger Initiative (EAI) to generate a best-performing ensemble. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate ensemble selection within the context of SCA.
